# Covid Virus Tracking

I engineered a C++ Application to mitigate the spread of the pandemic virus.

Utilizng this application users and instituions can track recent physical contacts by processing movement reports using CSV files using contact:
- Name
- Times
- Locations
- Close Contacts
- Means of Contact

Applicaiton output reports of infected patients and their recent contacts to warn them and mitigate the spread of Covid-19 and informs possibily infected patients via email or mobile.

The application utilizes:
- Covid Data API
- Global Datasets
- CSV Validity Checks
